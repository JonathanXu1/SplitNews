The repository for our HackLodge 2019 project, SplitNews.

# About
This project has been started to address the need for a safe and decentralized medium to share news. I'm concerned about the world's developments with regards to freedom of press, and I'm trying to solve a portion of this issue through this app.

Built as a native Android app in Kotlin

# Features:
Functional editor with reading and writing files
Somewhat functional WiFi direct connection (didn't get to sharing files in time)
